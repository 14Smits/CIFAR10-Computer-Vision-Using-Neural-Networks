Improvements we can make: 

See how the precision increases / error decreases as we train the model with the epochs. 

See how the NN looks like in a plot, maybe theres a cool way to do it. 

Maybe use a pretrained model too and see how complex it is.

How are we taking the test and train sets? We should add a random sampler but make sure we always use the seem seed for consistency.

See this document to see a model they made.
